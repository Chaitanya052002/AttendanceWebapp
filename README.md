### Welcome to my github account


I have developed an web application for recording attendance of employees/students.


Run applcation and user below admin and user two ids to login (Note : you can create users by registration and admin from backend(database))

admin id           =: admin@gmail.com 
admin password     =: a

user id            =: chaita@gmail.com
user password      =: a



### IMP : Please do create database in Postgresql with name "dbo" username: "postgres" and password: "admin"


User Steps
1) User can login and sign in/sign out in application. Respective date and time will be added to the reports.
2) User can also view report after adding sign in/sign out time.
3) User details are displayed on navigation bar.
4) All CRUD operations are performed during this operations

Admin Steps
1) Admin can login and view a list of all the registered users
2) Admin can view sign in and sign out times for each user
3) Responsive UI for viewing records.

Also used Spring Security for login logout and password encryption.
